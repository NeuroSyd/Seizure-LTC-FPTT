Seizure detection with a biologically plausible algorithm. We used Adaptive Spiking Neural Networks with Liquid-Time Constant Spiking Neurons and Forward Propagation Through Time (FPTT)
for the detection of seizures in scalp-EEG datasets. 

Code can be updated according to desired and relevant datasets.
